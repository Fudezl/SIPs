When opening a pull request to submit a new SIP, please use the suggested template: https://github.com/symblox/SIPs/blob/master/sip-template.md

We have a GitHub bot that automatically merges some PRs. It will merge yours immediately if certain criteria are met:

-   The PR edits only existing WIP PRs.
-   The build passes.
-   Your Github username or email address is listed in the 'author' header of all affected PRs, inside <triangular brackets>.
-   If matching on an email address, the email address is the one publicly listed on your GitHub profile.
